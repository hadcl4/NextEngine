# NextEngine

> Easy-to-use Game Engine written in Python, using Python

## What is "NextEngine"?
NextEngine is an easy-to-use, open-source, and simple yet powerful game engine written in Python, and uses Python as its programming language. Using the included `nextlib` library, which runs on top of Pygame, you can use the engine for things such as prototyping, experimenting, or just creating games. You can then distribute your game either as a Python package or use [third party tools](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#how-can-i-create-a-stand-alone-binary-from-a-python-script) to distribute it as a standalone executable. The choice is yours!

The main goal is the easy part. Unlike many game engines out there, NextEngine is so simple you can create a basic prototype in less than 100 lines of code. However, while it may be easy to use, it also is very powerful. Since the games you write in the engine are in Python, that means you also have access to all the thousands of modules out there. Mixing that with the easy-to-use `nextlib`, you've got yourself a very powerful, but easy, game engine. In some cases, you'll also be able to mix normal Pygame functions with `nextlib` ones in the same file, making the possibilities nearly endless!

## How do I know if my computer can run NextEngine?
Well, since NextEngine relies only on Python and a few modules (mainly Pygame and `guizero`), any operating system supporting those should work (though it has only been tested on Linux so far). As for how powerful the device needs to be, as long as it can run Pygame decently, NextEngine should work just fine.

## Where do I learn how to use NextEngine?
View the documentation [here](docs/README.md).

## Is NextEngine a good place to start if I have no coding experience?
NextEngine uses Python, which is a very easy-to-learn language. Combined with the very easy-to-learn commands in `nextlib`, NextEngine is a great place to start with making games using actual code.

Tip: Having trouble understanding a certain Python command? Remember, Python has [documentation](https://docs.python.org) too!

## Credits
NextEngine wouldn't be possible without the following:

- Pygame. Used in `nextlib`.
- LibreSprite. Images in NextEngine were created with this.
