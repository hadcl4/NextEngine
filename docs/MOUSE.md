# Mouse Input

Mouse input is important for PC games, whether it's used as the input for menus, for controlling the player character's movements, or anything else where avoiding the use of the keyboard might be convenient.

### `MouseClick()`

This will return either `True` or `False`, depending on whether the left mouse button is pressed or not.

### `MousePosition()`

This will return a list containing the X and Y coordinates of the mouse, using `nextlib`'s coordinate plane instead of pygame's.
